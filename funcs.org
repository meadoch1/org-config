Custom functions to help do things in org.

* Unique IDs
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1cdf1b4f-be05-472c-bba8-151462f02bb6
:END:

When entries have unique IDs it enables better cross referencing between entries
and links work even when entries are moved to different files.

This function will add ids to each headline in the file that does not already have one.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun my/org-add-ids-to-headlines-in-file ()
    "Add ID properties to all headlines in the current file which
  do not already have one."
    (interactive)
    (org-map-entries 'org-id-get-create))
#+END_SRC

This function will remove an id from an entry and remove it from the global list

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun my/org-id-remove-entry ()
    "Remove/delete the ID entry and update the databases.
  Update the `org-id-locations' global hash-table, and update the
  `org-id-locations-file'.  `org-id-track-globally' must be `t`."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (org-back-to-heading t)
      (when (org-entry-delete (point) "ID")
        (org-id-update-id-locations nil 'silent))))
